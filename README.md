How can generative AI technology improve productivity of an important everyday activity?

Using generative AI to improve Supply Chain Optimisation.
Building a predictive model to optimise procurement decisions and generate future recommendations by leveraging the available watsonx Generative AI.


Steps:
- Design an AI tool in a way that makes the model accessible, user-friendly and able to solve a real-world problem.
- Build a predictive model.
- Define use case and purpose. What problem does it solve?
- Build the backend
- Develop the frontend


Problem Statement:
The supply chain environment is becoming increasingly complex and competitive. 
Businesses face the challenge of managing fluctuating demand, reducing costs, and maintaining efficient operations while staying agile. 
Many organizations struggle with outdated, manual processes that are reactive and lack the ability to leverage data-driven insights.
Current methods fail to accurately predict demand or optimize procurement, leading to stockouts, excess inventory, and inefficient purchase orders. 

Solution:
Our comprehensive solution uses machine learning predictive models for demand forecasting, enabling dynamic procurement adjustments and automating purchase orders to improve efficiency, and provide actionable recommendations to improve supply chain performance.
Our ML solution can target a number of industries such as financial services, manufacturing, energy and utilities, retail, real estate, and technology.


Our USP and Benefits:
This machine learning-based supply chain optimization solution has the ability to provide accurate, real-time demand forecasts, enabling dynamic procurement adjustments and automating purchase orders. This leads to:

Increased Accuracy: Minimizes stockouts and overstocking with continuous improvement.
Real-Time Adaptability: Adjusts procurement in response to market changes.
Procurement Automation: Streamlines processes, reducing manual effort and errors.
Cost Efficiency: Optimizes inventory, lowering costs.
Data-Driven Insights: Empowers proactive, informed decision-making.
This solution uniquely combines predictive intelligence and automation for superior supply chain efficiency.


Why is our model important?:
This machine learning-based demand forecasting model is important because it addresses key challenges in supply chain management by:

Improving Forecast Accuracy: Predicting demand more precisely reduces excess inventory, stockouts, and waste.
Enhancing Efficiency: Automating procurement decisions and purchase orders eliminates manual tasks, speeding up processes and reducing human error.
Boosting Agility: The model adapts to market shifts and disruptions in real time, enabling businesses to respond quickly and stay competitive.
Cost Reduction: By optimizing inventory levels and procurement, it helps cut storage, handling, and operational costs.
Informed Decision-Making: It provides data-driven insights, helping businesses anticipate trends and make proactive decisions to improve supply chain resilience and performance.


In short, this model empowers businesses to optimize their supply chain with precision, agility, and efficiency, driving both cost savings and operational excellence.
